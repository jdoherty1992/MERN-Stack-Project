# Mern Stack Project 
A real-time chat application built with the MERN stack, inspired by a video tutorial from [burakorkmez/mern-chat-app](https://github.com/burakorkmez/mern-chat-app).  
The UI has been customized, and additional features have been implemented including a profile page where user information can be changed and profile can be deleted.

**Real-time Communication:** Powered by Socket.io for live chat functionality

**Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

**Online Status Tracking:** Uses React Context and Socket.io to show active users

**State Management:** Lightweight and scalable with Zustand

**Error Handling:** Implemented on both client and server sides for better stability

**Styling:** TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for a clean and responsive design

**Tutorial**

Create a profile by clicking on 'Don't have an account?'

Log in and message other users 

**Username and Password** for testing: Each user has the same password '123456' with their username being their full name in lowercase with no spaces (eg. Joe Dolan --> joedolan)

To Update or Delete profile, click on the profile icon at bottom of sidebar
